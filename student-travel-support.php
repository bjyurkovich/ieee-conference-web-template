		The Organizing Committee of CCTA 2017 is pleased to announce Student Travel Support, made available by the IEEE Control Systems Society. These funds are meant to enhance the chances of promising students to attend CCTA 2017, present their papers and become more integrated into the CSS scientific community. The limited amount of funds available are not reimbursed to the student awardees, but are applied by the conference organizers to (i) conference registration and (ii) partial lodging expenses; please <a href="http://www.ieeecss.org/member-activities/ieee-css-student-travel-support" style="color:red" target="_blank">click here</a> for more information.
