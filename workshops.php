			CCTA 2017 is pleased to be offering Workshops on topics in control technology and applications. These tutorials are proposed, organized and delivered by international experts from academia, national laboratories, and industry. Information on the half-day and full-day workshops is given below; for additional information, contact the Workshops Chair, <a style="color: red;cursor: pointer;" href="mailto:rgregg@utdallas.edu">Robert Gregg</a>.
			<br /><br />
			All Workshops will take place prior to the conference on Sunday, August 27, and will be held in rooms set up in classroom style at the conference venue (Mauna Lani Bay Hotel). Beverages will be provided during coffee breaks in the morning and afternoon for paid Workshop registrants, whereas participants are on their own for the lunch break during the full-day Workshops.
			<br /><br />
			Participants may <a href="registration.php" style="color:red">register</a> for Workshops through the conference webpage or on site; the registration desk for the Workshops is the same as the registration desk for the conference, located outside the conference meeting rooms. 

			<br /><br />

			<div style="font-style: italic;">Please note that space is limited for each Workshop, and the proposed Workshops are subject to cancellation if the number of registrants fails to meet specified minimums.</div>

			<h2>W1: Half Day Workshop (1:00PM to 6:00PM)</h2>	
			<h3>Fault Diagnosis in Complex Systems Using Structural Analysis, and Application to Automotive Functional Safety</h3>
			<div><span style="font-weight: bold">Organizer: </span> Dr. Giorgio Rizzoni, The Ohio State University</div>
			<div><span style="font-weight: bold">Presenter: </span> Dr. Giorgio Rizzoni, The Ohio State University</div>
			<p>
				Functional safety and related standards in the automotive industry require systematic approaches to fault diagnosis and prognosis for complex, large scale systems. This workshop presents an overview of model based approaches to this subject area. Individual topics for be covered include: Basic concepts fault diagnosis theory and overview of existing approaches; structural analysis-based fault diagnosis; residual generation and threshold selection.  The Workshop concludes with a case study in automated automotive manual transmissions, and discussion with participants will be encouraged throughout. 
				<br /><br />
				The target audience for this Workshop includes graduate students, industry practitioners, and academic researchers interested in the subject of fault diagnosis and functional safety.

			<p>
				This one day workshop will focus on current topics and solutions in guidance, navigation and control that are having an impact in the aerospace industry. The workshop will be presented by leading GNC experts from industry, government and academia that are involved in some of the most exciting research and development efforts. This workshop is sponsored and presented by members of the IEEE Technical Committee on Aerospace Controls and their affiliates and will cover current industry topics in GNC for manned and unmanned aircraft (UAV's), guided missiles, space launch vehicles, satellites, and precision guided projectiles. Although no classified or export restricted information will be presented, the workshop authors will explain the relevant theory behind recent developments, provide comparative solutions and methods, and give simplified GNC models for further study and analysis. The workshop will offer opportunities for questions and answers, and provide an open forum for discussion of applications for current theoretical advances and potential enabling technologies.
				<br /><br />
				The target audience for this Workshop includes students and professors in search of current applications in need of solutions as well as industry and government professionals in search of potential solutions from academia and adjacent branches of the aerospace industry.

				This one-day workshop aims to summarize and review influential ideas and technologies regarding the fast developing Internet of Things (IoT) that will be of br /oad interests to the audience of CCTA2017. This workshop will bring together researchers in the control society with industry participants to reveal the trends in the IoT domain and its relevance to the control community. IoT is becoming a novel research topic that integrates control, networking, and sensing beyond the scope of any single discipline towards a large number of applications. Many new research directions can be defined, reflecting the trending topics such as big data, cloud computing, strong artificial intelligence, and cyber-security. However, the diversity of the knowledge required could become a hurdle for graduate students and researchers in control related applications who would like to contribute to this topic. The workshop will provide information that are not necessarily familiar to the control community, but are considered as key components of essential building blocks to enable cyber cycles e.g. many control loops and data flows that enable the IoT in application domains. Both industrial effort and academic endeavors will be presented. A few selected methods will be discussed in details so that the audience will be able to see the connections among the key ideas, or get over certain technical difficulties when reading influential papers published on this topic.
				<br /><br />
				The target audience for this Workshop includes control researchers and practitioners who are not already familiar with IoT, as well as established researchers who are searching for new areas of interests.
